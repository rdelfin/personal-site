        <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col mdl-card__supporting-text no-padding">
          <p>The software for this car is written in C++ for the Robot Operating System (ROS). In this
            system, you can create separate programs called <em>nodes</em>. They all communicate through
            defined topics and services.</p>
          <p>This car has a node that sends commands directly to the motor controllers and creates a
            service that sets the speed and direction settings for each motor. A separate node uses
            that service to provide a drive service, where you can provide a direction and speed for
            the entire car.</p>
          <p>The great thing about ROS is you can add all sorts of services and make them entirely modular
            and detached. These nodes can create a topic for encoders, ultrasonic sensors, more motors,
            an HTTP client for twitter, you name it!</p>

          <p>The motors are a standard set of <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13302">Sparkfun
            hobby gearmotors</a>. These are controller by two,
            <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9457">Sparkfun tb6612fng motor controllers</a>.
            These are hooked up directly to the Raspberry Pi output pins, and controlled using software
          PWM.</p>
          <p>The power was an interesting challenge. There are two power sources for the robot: One used
            by the motors and the controllers (motor power), the other used by the Raspberry Pi (main
            power). The first is provided by a single 9V battery. The second is powered by a cellphone
            battery pack, mostly because Raspberry Pi's were not technically designed by a regular battery
            and so can only be provided power through their micro-USB port. Yay bodging!</p>
