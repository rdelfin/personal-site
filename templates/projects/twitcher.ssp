        <h3 class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-typography--headline">How does it work?</h3>
        <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--6-col mdl-card__supporting-text no-padding">
          <p>This project makes use of the <a href="https://github.com/utexas-bwi/bwi_common">BWI
            Project</a> codebase. Specifically, the bwi_kr_execution, or knowledge reasoner, package.
            This provides a set of services to send goals to the robots.</p>
          <p>The twitter handler is divided into 4 distinct components: The twitter connection, the
            manager, the interpreter and the action executor. The twitter connection essentially is
            in charge of connecting to twitter, both directly fetching new tweets and sending responses.</p>
          <p>The second, the manager, coordinates all actions. It receives new tweets from the connection,
            decides when to send responses, and sends requests to both the interpreter and action executors.</p>
          <p>Next up, we have the interpreter. This one is in charge of converting tweets into an action.
            This self-contained box is where all the research will happen going forward. Currently is uses
            a simple regex pattern, but the long term goal is to use NLP to identify messages accordingly.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have the action executor. This one simply translates action messages into goals
            to be sent to the knowledge reasoner. From here, we can ask the robot to create a plan to go to
            a particular room or hallway.</p>
